The main objective of this project is to create a native Android app that allows users to browse, search, and discover movies using data fetched from a public API (such as TMDB). The app will feature a modern, declarative UI, following Android MDC design principles, and adopt a clean architecture approach. It will also integrate unit testing to ensure reliability, and focus on UI/UX best practices with smooth animations, error handling, and secure storage of API keys.
